# Data Visualisation in Healthcare
### For this project, I developed an interactive web application that visualised real indoor environmental quality (IEQ) sensor data, including temperature, light, sound, and CO2 levels. My application can be used in healthcare facilities, so healthcare professionals can easily see and manage the comfort levels of their patients.
### I used the plotly.js coding library to create the visualisations.
